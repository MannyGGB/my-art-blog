Mignon, a painter of flower still-lifes, came from Frankfurt and lived in Utrecht. His lavish flower still-lifes look very similar to those of his master Jan Davidsz de Heem, but they are a little stronger in form and colour.

The painting belongs with the other flower still-life that is also hanging here. They come from the collection of the Orange-Nassau family and were hung in Oranienstein Castle in Diez, Germany, in the eighteenth century.
