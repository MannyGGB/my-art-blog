A lot of that nostalgia came from Sea of Stars’ gorgeous pixel art, which looks similar to games like Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger but with an incredible amount of modern-day detail. Leaves sway slightly as if moved by a real breeze. Water ripples as people run through it. When main characters talk, their text boxes have expressive faces that make each of them feel memorable. Hyper-detailed bosses can take up half the screen with their extra appendages or giant heads. Every time I got to a new area, I couldn’t wait to see what visual delights were ahead.
